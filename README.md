This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

# About

Thinking about what the market is using and what is the best...

# The Stack

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org)
- [Bun](https://bun.sh)
- [Supabase](https://supabase.com)
- [Auth.js](https://authjs.dev)
- Mantine
    - *Why not ***v0***, it's faster to get things done with Mantine.
- [Stripe](https://stripe.com)

### Why not

- **Remix?**
    - Remix is a great tool, but unfortunatelly there aren't Remix jobs in the market nowadays. Also, it's less straightforward than Next.js to deploy it.

- **Appwrite?**
    - It's a great platform but Supabase has more community support. Also, while both platforms don't support transactions, Supabase at least has RPC.
- **Shadcn & Tailwind CSS?**
    - While they are a great combination and can benefit from

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
